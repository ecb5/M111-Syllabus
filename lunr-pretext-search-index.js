So the recipe for success is simple: Work through and solve as many problems, from as many sources as you possibly can. You must do this yourself. No one can do it for you. My role is to help you think clearly about how to approach a problem, how solve it, and how to know that you have solved it.  I will begin every class session by asking if there are any questions. This is your opportunity to learn. If you have been working unsuccessfully on a problem, or if you have solved a problem but are still not sure that you understand it, ask about it in class and we will all discuss it then.  I do not guarantee that I will solve the problem for you (although sometimes I might). That is not my role. My role is to help you understand the mathematics you are here to learn. Most often I will simply give you a push in the right direction, tell you to try again, and suggest that you ask again if you still can't make any progress.  "

  "title": "Class Participation",
  "body": "Class Participation  Your level of participation during class will be graded and this will be the single largest individual piece of your final course grade. Specifically, you start every class day with 2 points. If you fail to participate in the day's work you can lose one or both points, subject to my discretion. More detail on this follows.  I rarely lecture for the entirety of a class. Instead most of any given class period will be spent with you working on a problem, or a set of problems at your desks. If you are not working on the problems it will cost you at least one participation point. Sometimes I will call on a class member at random to talk with me about a problem. If you refuse to respond it will cost you at least one participation point.  But be clear about this. These are participation points, not attendance points and not getting-the-right-answer points.  It is perfectly acceptable to be unable to solve a problem or answer a question in class. It is not acceptable to refuse to discuss the problem. For example, suppose call on you to share your solution to some problem, but you haven't been able to finish it. It is perfectly acceptable to say, \"I wasn't able to finish.\" In that case I'll ask you to explain whatever progress you have made and the discussion will continue. It is not acceptable to say, \"I don't know. Call on someone else.\" and then refuse to discuss the problem further. You will lose your participation points for that day. I do not expect you will able to correctly answer any random question that I throw at you. But I do expect you to participate in the classroom discussions.  I cannot emphasize this enough. Solving the problem is far less important trying to solve the problem, for it is in the trying that learning happens. Being able to solve a given problem means that you have learned as much as you can from it, and it is time to move on to a problem you don't know how to solve.  You will only succeed if you spend as much time trying to solve problems as you possibly can. I will therefore make every effort to keep the lecture time to a bare minimum so that you can work on problems in class as much as possible.  Teaching others is also a good way to refine and deepen your understanding. A secondary goal for having you solve problems in class rather than on your own is so that you can learn from each other as well as from me. If I throw out a problem that you find easy, look around for a classmate who is struggling and offer to help them out. You will learn as much as the student you are helping. Who knows, you might even make a friend.  Class participation will contribute 450 points toward your final grade. The lowest two will be dropped.  "

Each WebWork assignment will only be available to you for a fixed amount of time, so get started early and keep trying.  You can earn as many as points toward your final course grade from the WeBWorK problems. You can keep submitting solutions to any WeBWork problem until you either get it right or the due date passes. All that will be recorded is whether or not you finally did get the right answer before the assignment closes.  The first assignment (named 'Orientation') will not count toward your grade, but you should do it anyway. It is essentially a short tutorial on how to use WeBWorK.  It is extremely unwise to wait until the night a set of WeBWorK problems is due to begin doing them. This is because it will not be clear how to do some of the problems the first time you look at them. If you don't start on them until the night they are due you will not have a chance to ask about them in class, so you will not learn what you need to learn from those problems.  WeBWorK advice  Your best option is to open and try the WeBWorK problems as soon as they open. Some of them will be challenging and you don't want to be doing them in a panic at the last minute.  This will be reflected in your exam grades and your final course grade.  The WeBWorK will contribute up to points to your course grade.  "

  "body": "Computing Technology  Computing technology is a reality of the world we live in. You have been using it all of your life and you will probably continue to do so. You are welcome to use whatever computing technology you want to during class, during exams, and during quizzes.  But this course is not about how to use computing technology so your best strategy is to use it in a manner which helps you learn. For example, use technology to confirm your problem solutions after you've made a serious effort to solve them, not before.  As I said, you are welcome to use any computing tech you want during quizzes and exams, but I recommend very strongly against it.  I repeat: I recommend against using computing technology during quizzes and\/or exams, but I will allow you to do it.  This is not me being kind. Quite the opposite.  Because this course is about understanding and applying abstract concepts I design the quiz\/exam problems to test your understanding not your ability to compute. Such problems will always require you to explain the results of any computations that you do, and the explanation is much more important than the computation because that is where your level of understanding will be displayed.  For example, a quiz or exam problem on the Quadratic Formula might be something like this.    Problem: Show that the solutions of the equation are and .   An excellent response to this problem would be   Since we have Thus the solutions of are the same as the solutions of or , which are and .   A mediocre response to this problem would be       A poor response to this problem would be       In fact this is such a poor response that it would get a score of zero.

Pluses and Minuses:  At the end of the semester if your computed grade seems to me to be lower than your level of mastery warrants I reserve the right to raise your grade with a plus or minus.  For example, if you have points your computed grade would be a C but it is at the very high end of the C range. If, in my opinion, your level of mastery indicates that a higher grade is appropriate I will raise this to a B-.  In similar circumstances if you have points I would raise your grade to a C+. Such adjustments will be rare and will be done solely at my discretion.  Finally, I will never lower your grade in this manner. If your score is points you will get no less than a C.

Can you prove that your guess is correct?   Finally, what is the differential of if are assumed to be (unknown) constants?    Show that the differential of each of the following is:           Now compute the differential of Why is this one different?  Find the Pattern  Compute for each of the following.                                                   What do you think the the differential of will be if and are (arbitrary, unknown) constants?

You can use the Desmos interface above, open Desmos in another window, use your calculator, or any other graphing software to do this. If the line you found isn't tangent to the graph then you made a mistake. Try again or ask for help.
