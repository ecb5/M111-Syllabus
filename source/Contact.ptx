<section><title>Contacting Me</title>
<p>
  You may contact me by any of the following methods (listed in
  decreasing order of effectiveness): 
</p>
<p>
  <ol>
    <li><title>Raise your hand during class and ask your question</title>
    <p>
      I will be in class 3 days a week. This is your time. You
      have my undivided attention. If you have a question which
      is not personal this is the best time to get an answer.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li><title> Speak to me just before or just after
    class</title>
    <p>
      Some questions might involve personal
      information that you don't want to share with
      the rest of the class. Simple matters can be
      handled quickly in the interim between
      classes, or if the problem is more complex we
      can arrange to meet another time.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li><title> Speak to me in my office during my office
    hours</title>
    <p>
      Office hours are your time. This is time when I will be in my
      office specifically to help my students (that's you). I will
      take questions of any kind from my students on a first
      come/first served basis during my posted office hours. If I am
      doing something else when you arrive (including talking to
      other faculty) I will put it aside when you come to my office
      during my office hours. Don't be shy. Be sure I know you are there. 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><title> Make an appointment to speak to me outside of my office
  hours</title>
  <p>
    Office hours exist so you can speak to your faculty one-on-one. My
    office hours are posted. If you are not free during any of my
    posted office hours let me know and we'll work out a mutually
    convenient time to speak.
  </p>
</li>
<li><title> Email</title>
<aside><title>If I Don't Respond</title>
  <p>
    If you send me an email and I do not respond it does not mean that
    I hate you, or that I'm ignoring you. If I see it I <em>will</em>
    respond. If I don't it simply means that I didn't see your email.
    Please bring your issue to me in my office or during the next
    class.
  </p>
  <p>
    Better yet, bring it to me during class in the first place.
  </p>
</aside>
<p>
  My Penn State email address is ecb5@psu.edu. Feel free to use it. <alert>However
    </alert>
  this is the <em>least</em> effective method of reaching me and I
  urge you not to rely on it. I only check my email once a day at most
  and I receive hundreds of emails a day. If I see your email I will
  respond but it could easily take me several days to see it, or I
  might miss it entirely.
