  <title>Contacting Me</title>
  <p>
    You may contact me by any of the following methods (listed in
    decreasing order of effectiveness): 
  </p>
  <p>
    <dl>
      <li><title>Speak up  during class</title>
      <p>
        I will be in class with you <m> 2</m> days a week. This is your time. You
        have my undivided attention. If you have a question which
        is not personal this is the best time to get an answer.
      </p>
      </li>
      <li><title> Speak to me immediately before or after
      class</title>
      <p>
        Some questions might involve personal information that you don't
        want to share with the rest of the class. Simple matters can be
        handled quickly before or after class. If the issue is more
        complex we can arrange to meet another time.
      </p>
<p>
  If you are not free immediately before or after class but need to
  speak to me let me know and we'll work out a mutually convenient
  time to speak.

<!--         <li><title> Speak to me in my office during my office -->
<!--         hours</title> -->
<!--         <p> -->
<!--           Office hours are your time. This is time when I will be in my -->
<!--           office specifically to help my students (that's you). I will -->
<!--           take questions of any kind from my students on a first -->
<!--           come/first served basis during my posted office hours.  -->
<!-- <!-\- If I am -\-> -->
<!-- <!-\-           doing something else when you arrive (including talking to -\-> -->
<!-- <!-\-           other faculty) I will put it aside when you come to my office -\-> -->
<!-- <!-\-           during my office hours. Don't be shy. Be sure I know you are there. -\-> -->
<!--         </p> -->
<!--       </li> -->
      <!-- <li><title> Make an appointment to speak to me outside of class.</title> -->
      <!-- <p> -->
      <!--   During summer sessions I've found that scheduling regular office -->
      <!--   hours is a waste of time. Inevitably most of the class is -->
      <!--   unavailable during whatever times I choose. So instead I make -->
      <!--   myself as available as much as I can <alert>by -->
      <!--   appointment</alert>. If you want to speak to me please let me -->
      <!--   know and work with me to find a mutually convenient time. -->
      <!-- </p> -->
      <!-- <p> -->
      <!--   That is, I will not be available 24/7 at a moment's notice, but if -->
      <!--   you need to speak to me outside of class, send me an email and we -->
      <!--   will either handle the issue by email or we will find a mutually -->
      <!--   convenient time to meet online. -->
  <!--     <p> -->
  <!-- <!-\- Office hours exist so you can speak to your faculty one-on-one. My -\-> -->
  <!-- <!-\- office hours are posted.  -\-> -->
  <!-- If you are not free immediately before or after class but need to -->
  <!-- speak to me let me know and we'll work out a mutually convenient -->
  <!-- time to speak. -->
  <!--     </p> -->
  <!--     </li> -->
      <li><title> Email</title>
      <p>
        My email address is <url href="mailto:eboman@gettysburg.edu" visual="eboman@gettysburg.edu">eboman@gettysburg.edu</url>. I
        usually check it several times per day. Feel free to use it.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I do not sit at my desk and
        continuously monitor my email. Sometimes it will take time for
        me to respond. Usually you will get a response by the next day
        at the latest, expecially if I don't see your email until late
        in the day.
      </p>
</li>
<li>
<title> If I Don't Respond to an Email</title>
      <!-- <p> -->
      <!--   Your emails are important to me, but I get <alert>many</alert> -->
      <!--   emails every day at multiple addresses. It is easy to miss the -->
      <!--   important ones. -->
      <!-- </p> -->
      <p>
        If you send me an email and I do not respond it does not mean
        that I hate you, or that I'm ignoring you. It simply means
        that I didn't see it.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I see your email I will make every possible effort to
        respond. If I don't respond in a reasonable time please send
        it again. Or, if there is no rush, bring your the issue to me
        during the next class. I'd rather talk to you in person anyway.
      </p>
      <!-- <p> -->
      <!--   Better yet, bring it to me during class in the first place. -->
      <!-- </p> -->
