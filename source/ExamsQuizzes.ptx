  <p>
    There will be <m>2</m> exams given during the semester. See the course
    schedule for the dates. Each exam will be on the material covered
    since the last exam, and will contribute <m>50</m> points toward your
    course grade.  The exam problems will most likely be taken from the
    In Class Exercises, the textbooks, or the WeBWorK but this is not
    guaranteed.

    You can make up a missed exam during the first week after it
    was given for a score reduction of <m>10</m>%, and during the second
    week after it was given for a score reduction of <m>20</m>%. After
    that, or if the semester ends before you make up an exam your
    score on that exam will be <m>0</m>. The exams will contribute up to
    <m>100</m> points toward your grade in the course.
