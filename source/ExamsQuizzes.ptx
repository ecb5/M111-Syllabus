  <p>
    There will be <m>2</m> exams given during the semester; one near
    the middle of the semester and the second at the end of the
    semester during Final Exams week.<aside>
<title>Exam Dates</title>
<p>
We will decide the date of the mid-semester exam later. We will make this decision together.
</p></aside>
 Each exam will be on the
    material covered since the last exam, and will contribute
    <m>50</m> points toward your course grade.  The exam problems will
    most likely be taken from the Practice Problems, the textbook,
    or the WeBWorK but this is not guaranteed.

    You can make up a missed exam during the first week after it
    was given for a score reduction of <m>10</m>%, and during the second
    week after it was given for a score reduction of <m>20</m>%. After
    that your
    score on that exam will be <m>0</m>. The exams will contribute up to
    <m>100</m> points toward your grade in the course.

<p>
  There will be a quiz at the end of class <em>every</em> Wednesday,

<title>Week 1</title>
<p>
The
  first week is a bit problematic since we only meet twice a week. We'll discuss how we will handle the first quiz on the first day of class.

 except when exams are
  scheduled. Each quiz will be:
  <ul> 
    <li> <m>20</m> minutes long, </li>
    <li> worth <m>10</m> (quiz) points. </li> 
  </ul> 
  The average of all of the quizzes will contribute 150 (course)
  points toward your final course grade. There will be no makeup
  quizzes for any reason because the lowest quiz score will be
  dropped.
