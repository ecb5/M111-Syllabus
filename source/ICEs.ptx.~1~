<section><title>Class Participation</title>
<p>
  Your level of participation during class will be graded and this will
  be the single largest individual piece of your final course grade. 
  Specifically, you start every class day with 2 points. If you fail to
  participate in the day's work you can lose one or both points, subject
  to my discretion. More detail on this follows.
</p>
<p>
  I rarely lecture for the entirety of a 50 minute class. Instead I
  will frequently interupt my lecture to ask a question or to ask you
  to solve a small problem for practice. I will then call on a class
  member at random to talk about the problem with me. If you fail to
  respond it will cost you at least one participation point. 
</p>
<p>
  Be clear about this. These are <em> participation </em> points, not
  <em> getting-the-right-answer </em> points.
</p>
<p>
  It is perfectly acceptable to be unable to solve a problem or answer a
  question in class. It is <alert> not </alert> acceptable to refuse to
  discuss the problem.  For example, suppose I ask you to solve a
  problem but you aren't able to finish it. If I then call on you to
  share your answer it is perfectly acceptable to say, "I wasn't able to
  finish." In that case I'll ask you to explain what you did to solve
  the problem and the discussion will continue. It is <alert> not
  </alert> acceptable to say, "I don't know. Call on someone else." and
  then refuse to discuss the problem further. You will lose your
  participation points for that day.  I do not expect you will able to
  correctly answer any random question that I throw at you. But I
  <alert>do</alert> expect you to <alert> participate</alert>.
</p>

<p>
  I cannot emphasize this enough. <em>Solving</em> the problem is far
  less important <alert>trying to solve</alert> the problem, for it is
  in the trying that learning happens. Being able to solve a given
  problem means that you have learned as much as you can from it, and it
  is time to move on to a problem you <alert>don't</alert> know how to
  solve.
</p>
<p>
  You will only succeed if you spend as much time trying to solve
  problems as you possibly can. I will therefore make every effort to
  keep the lecture time to a bare minimum so that you can work on
  problems in class as much as possible. 
</p>

<p>
  A secondary goal for having you solve problems in class rather than
  on your own is so that you can learn from each other as well as from
  me. Feel free to talk to each other. Who knows, you might even make a
  friend.
</p>
<p>
  Class participation will contribute 450 points toward your
  final grade.  The lowest two will be dropped.
