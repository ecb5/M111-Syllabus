<section><title> Computing Technology</title>
<p>
  Computing technology is a reality of the world we live in. You have
  been using it all of your life and you will probably continue to do
  so. You are welcome to use whatever computing technology you want to
  during class, during exams, and during quizzes.
</p>
<p>
  But this course is not about how to use computing technology so
  your best strategy is to use it in a manner which helps you
  learn. For example, use technology to confirm your problem
  solutions <alert>after</alert> you've made a serious effort to
  solve them, not before. 
</p>
<p>
  As I said, you are welcome to use any computing tech you want during quizzes
  and exams, but I recommend <alert>very strongly</alert> against it.
</p>
<p>
  <alert>I repeat:</alert> I recommend <em>against</em> using computing
  technology during quizzes and/or exams, but I <alert>will</alert>
  allow you to do it.
</p>
<p>
  This is not me being kind. Quite the opposite.
</p>
<p>
  Because this course is about understanding and applying abstract
  concepts I design the quiz/exam problems to test your
  <alert>understanding</alert> not your ability to compute.  Such
  problems will 
<em>
always
</em>
require you to <em>explain</em> the results of any
  computations that you do, and the explanation is much more important
  than the computation because that is where your level of
  understanding will be displayed.
</p>
<p>
For example, a quiz or exam problem on the Quadratic Formula might be
something like this.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

<alert>
Problem:
</alert>
Show that the solutions of the equation
<m>x^2+2x-24=0</m> are <m>x = 4</m> and  <m>x = -6</m>.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
An 
<alert>
excellent
</alert>
response to this problem would be
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Since <m>x^2+2x-24  = (x-4)(x+6)</m> we have
<md>
 <mrow>x^2+2x-24 \amp =0</mrow>
<mrow> (x-4)(x+6) \amp =0.</mrow>
</md>
Thus the solutions of <m>x^2+2x-24=0</m> are the same as the solutions
of  <m>x-4=0</m> or <m>x+6=0</m>, which are <m>x=4</m> and
<m>x=-6</m>.
</p>
</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<md>
 <mrow>x^2+2x-24 \amp =0</mrow>
<mrow> (x-4)(x+6) \amp =0</mrow>
<mrow> x\amp =4        </mrow>
<mrow> x\amp =-6.      </mrow>
</md>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A

response to this problem would be
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<md>
<mrow> x\amp =4        </mrow>
<mrow> x\amp =-6.      </mrow>
</md>

<p>
Do you see why?
