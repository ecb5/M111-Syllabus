  I will also assign regular homework problems via the WeBWork
  system. Each WebWork assignment will only be available to you for a
  fixed amount of time (usually about one week), so get started early
  and keep trying.
</p>
<p>
 You can earn as many as <m>300</m> points toward your
  final course grade from the WeBWorK problems. You can keep
  submitting solutions to any WeBWork problem until you either
  get it right or the due date passes. All that will be
  recorded is whether or not you finally did get the right
  answer before the assignment closes. 
</p>
<p>
  The first assignment (named 'Orientation') will not
  count toward your grade, but you should do it anyway. It is
  essentially a short tutorial on how to use WeBWorK.

<p>
 Your best option is to open and try the WeBWorK problems as
  soon as they open. Some of them will be challenging and you don't
  want to be doing them in a panic at the last minute.

<p>
  It is extremely unwise to wait until the night a set of WeBWorK
  problems is due to begin doing them.  This is because it will not be
  clear how to do some of the problems the first time you look at
  them. If you don't start on them until the night they are due you
  will not have a chance to ask about them in class, so you will not
  learn what you need to learn from those problems. This will be reflected in
  your exam grades and your final course grade.

<p>
  The WeBWorK will contribute up to <m>300</m> to your grade in the
  course.
