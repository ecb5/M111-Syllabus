<section><title>Grading Policies</title>
<p>
  You can earn as many as 1000 points during this semester:
<aside><title>Participation Score</title>
<p>
For example: Suppose  this  class is conducted <m>12</m> times. Then
<m>C=12</m>. If you earned <m>2</m> points (this is the most you can
earn) in <m>10</m> of them, and only <m>1</m> in the other two then <m>P=2\times 10 + 1\times 2=22</m>.

</p>
<p>
In that case your participation score  is 
<m>225\times\frac{P}{C}=412.5</m>.
</p>

</aside>
  <ul>
    <li>
      450 for Participation
    </li>
    <li>
      300 from the WeBWork problems,
    </li>
    <li>
      150 from the quizzes,
    </li>
    <li>
      100 from the two exams (50 points each).
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  The grade you receive at the end of this semester will
  be computed as follows:
</p>
<p>
  Let <m>P</m> be the number of Participation points you earned, and let <m>C</m> be the number of days class is conducted. Then your participation score will be <m>225\times\frac{P}{C}</m>.
</p>

<aside><title>Quiz Score:</title>
<p>
  If <m>3</m> quizzes are
  given on which you got <m>2</m>, <m>7</m>, and <m>8</m> points then
  <m>Q=\frac{2+7+8}{3}=5.6</m>.

</p>
<p>
In that case your quiz score is <m>15Q=84</m>.
</p>
</aside><p>
  Let <m>Q</m> be the average of your quiz scores at the end of the
  semester. Then your quiz score is <m>15Q</m>.
</p>

<p>
  Let <m>W</m> be the number of Webwork problems you solved and let
  <m>T</m> be the total number of Webwork problems available. Then
  your Webwork score is <m>300\times\frac{W}{T}</m>.
</p>
<p>
  Your total points =
  <m> 225\left(\frac{P}{C}\right) + 300\left(\frac{W}{T}\right) + 15Q  + E1 + E2</m>
</p><aside><title>Please Check This Formula!!</title>
<p>
  Please make sure this formula is consistent with the information
  above <em>and let me know if it is not</em>. Some semesters I tweak
  the grading scheme a bit and inconsistencies can crop up. I try to
  catch these before the semester begins but sometimes I miss stuff.
</p>
</aside>
<p>
  Finally let <m>E1</m> and <m>E4</m> be your score on each of the
  exams.
</p>

<p>
<alert>
I do not use the gradebook on Moodle. If something shows up there it
is because I couldn't find a way to prevent it. I keep grade records
offline in a spreadsheet. Moreover, I do not keep your grade records
in a form that allows me to tell you what your "current" grade is.
  If you want a running record of your "current" grade you have to
  keep your own records of your Quiz, WeBWorK, Participation, and Exam scores.
</alert>
</p>
<aside>
<title>Pluses and Minuses:</title>
<p>
  At the end of the semester if your computed grade seems to me to be
  lower than your level of mastery warrants I reserve the right to
  raise your grade with a plus or minus.
</p>
<p>
  For example, if you have <m>795</m> points your computed grade would
  be a C but it is at the very high end of the C range.  If, in
  my opinion, your level of mastery indicates that a higher grade is
  appropriate I will raise this to a B-.
</p>
<p>
  In similar circumstances if you have <m>700</m> points I would
  raise your grade to a C+.  Such adjustments will be rare
  and will be done  <em>solely</em> at my discretion.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, I will <alert>never</alert> lower your grade in this
  manner. If your score is <m>700</m> points you will get no less
  than a C.
</p>
<p>
  Keep in mind that grades are <em>earned</em> not given.
</p>
</aside>
<p>
  Your course grade will be based on your total, according
  to the following table.
