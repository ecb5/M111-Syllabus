    Adjustments Due to  Illness
  </title>
    <!-- <p> -->
    <!--   If at any point during the semester I am unable to physically -->
    <!--   attend class on campus, but am otherwise able to teach (due to -->
    <!--   Covid, or whatever), we will -->
    <!--   switch to an online teaching mode via Zoom. I will explain how -->
    <!--   this will all work at that time, should it ever -->
    <!--   occur. Hopefully, it never will. -->
    <!-- </p> -->
    <p>
      If you are unable to attend class due to illness, let me know as
      soon as you are able to do so.  I will be reasonable as long as
      you keep me informed.
