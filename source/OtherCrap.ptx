  <subsection><title>Academic Integrity</title>
  <p>
    Academic dishonesty is not limited to simply cheating on an exam or
    assignment. The following is quoted directly from the "PSU Faculty
    Senate Policies for Students" regarding academic integrity and
    academic dishonesty: "Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly
    activity free from fraud and deception and is an educational objective
    of this institution. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited
    to, cheating, plagiarizing, fabricating of information or citations,
    facilitating acts of academic dishonesty by others, having
    unauthorized possession of examinations, submitting work of another
    person or work previously used without informing the instructor, or
    tampering with the academic work of other students."
  </p>
  <p>
    All University and Penn State Harrisburg policies regarding
    academic integrity/academic dishonesty apply to this course and
    the students enrolled in this course. Refer to <url
    href="http://harrisburg.psu.edu/academics/academic-guidelines-and-policies"
    visual="">Academic
    Integrity Policy</url> for further details on the academic
    integrity policy of Penn State Harrisburg.  Each student in this
    course is expected to work entirely on her/his own while taking
    any exam, to complete assignments on her/his own effort without
    the assistance of others unless directed otherwise by the
    instructor, and to abide by University and Penn State Harrisburg
    policies about academic integrity and academic
    dishonesty. Academic dishonesty can result in an assignment of "F"
    or "XF" as the final grade for the student.

To receive consideration for accommodations, you must contact Student DisAbility Resources (SDR), participate in an intake interview, provide documentation of your disability, and complete a Self-Assessment. Additional information is available on the Disability Services website (http://harrisburg.psu.edu/disability-services). If the documentation supports requests for reasonable accommodations, SDR will provide you with an accommodations letter, which you will give to your professors. You will receive accommodations after you give your accommodations letters to your professors. You should share your accommodations letters with your professors as early in the semester as possible. Professors do not provide accommodations retroactively.

<subsection><title>Mandated Reporting</title>
<p>
  One of your instructor's responsibilities is to help create a safe
  learning environment on our campus. Your instructor also has a
  mandatory reporting responsibility related to their role as an
  educator. It is your instructor's goal that you feel able to share
  information related to your life experiences in classroom discussions,
  in your written work, and in one-on-one meetings. Your instructor will
  seek to keep information you share private to the greatest extent
  possible. However, per University policy AD85, your instructor is
  required to share information regarding sexual misconduct or
  information about a crime with the University including incidents of
  sex-based discrimination and harassment (discrimination, harassment,
  sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic
  violence, stalking, and retaliation). While faculty are ethically
  bound to report any information as it relates to University policy,
  they are also a resource and want to be sure you are aware of the
  services available to you.
</p>
<p>
  The first resource that should you should contact is Perdeta Bush,
  Penn State Harrisburg Title IX Office, E131 Olmsted Building
  (717-948-6180).
