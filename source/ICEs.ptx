<section><title>Class Participation</title>
<p>
  Your level of participation during class will be graded and this will
  be the single largest individual piece of your final course grade. 
  Specifically, you start every class day with 2 points. If you fail to
  participate in the day's work you can lose one or both points, subject
  to my discretion. More detail on this follows.
</p>
<p>
  I rarely lecture for the entirety of a class. Instead most of any
  given class period will be spent with you working on a problem, or a
  set of problems at your desks. If you are not working on the
  problems it will cost you at least one participation
  point. Sometimes I will call on a class member at random to talk
  with me about a problem. If you refuse to respond it will cost you
  at least one participation point. 
</p>
<p>
  But be clear about this. These are <em> participation </em> points,
  not <em> attendance </em> points and not <em>
  getting-the-right-answer </em> points.
</p>
<p>
  It is perfectly acceptable to be unable to solve a problem or answer
  a question in class. It is not acceptable to refuse to discuss the
  problem.  For example, suppose call on you to share your solution to
  some problem, but you haven't been able to finish it.  It is
  perfectly acceptable to say, "I wasn't able to finish."  In that
  case I'll ask you to explain  whatever progress you have made
  and the discussion will continue. It is not acceptable to say, "I
  don't know. Call on someone else." and then refuse to discuss the
  problem further. You will lose your participation points for that
  day.  I do not expect you will able to correctly answer any random
  question that I throw at you. But I do expect you to
  participate in the classroom discussions.
</p>

<p>
  I cannot emphasize this enough. Solving the problem is far
  less important <em>trying to solve</em> the problem, for it is
  in the trying that learning happens. Being able to solve a given
  problem means that you have learned as much as you can from it, and it
  is time to move on to a problem you don't know how to
  solve.
</p>
<p>
  You will only succeed if you spend as much time trying to solve
  problems as you possibly can. I will therefore make every effort to
  keep the lecture time to a bare minimum so that you can work on
  problems in class as much as possible. 
</p>

<p>
Teaching others is also a good way to refine and deepen your understanding.   A secondary goal for having you solve problems in class rather than
  on your own is so that you can learn from each other as well as from
  me. If I throw out a problem that you find easy, look around for a classmate who is struggling and offer to help them out. You will learn as much as the student you are helping. Who knows, you might even make a
  friend.
</p>
<p>
  Class participation will contribute 450 points toward your
  final grade.  The lowest two will be dropped.
