  <title>Contacting Me</title>
  <p>
    You may contact me by any of the following methods (listed in
    decreasing order of effectiveness): 
  </p>
  <p>
    <dl>
      <li><title>Raise your hand during class and ask your question</title>
      <p>
        I will be in class with you <m> 3</m> days a week. This is your time. You
        have my undivided attention. If you have a question which
        is not personal this is the best time to get an answer.
      </p>
      </li>
      <li><title> Speak to me just before or just after
      class</title>
      <p>
        Some questions might involve personal information that you don't
        want to share with the rest of the class. Simple matters can be
        handled quickly before or after class. If the issue is more
        complex we can arrange to meet another time.
      </p>
      </li>
        <li><title> Speak to me in my office during my office
        hours</title>
        <p>
          Office hours are your time. This is time when I will be in my
          office specifically to help my students (that's you). I will
          take questions of any kind from my students on a first
          come/first served basis during my posted office hours. 
<!-- If I am -->
<!--           doing something else when you arrive (including talking to -->
<!--           other faculty) I will put it aside when you come to my office -->
<!--           during my office hours. Don't be shy. Be sure I know you are there. -->
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><title> Make an appointment to speak to me outside of class.</title>
      <!-- <p> -->
      <!--   During summer sessions I've found that scheduling regular office -->
      <!--   hours is a waste of time. Inevitably most of the class is -->
      <!--   unavailable during whatever times I choose. So instead I make -->
      <!--   myself as available as much as I can <alert>by -->
      <!--   appointment</alert>. If you want to speak to me please let me -->
      <!--   know and work with me to find a mutually convenient time. -->
      <!-- </p> -->
      <!-- <p> -->
      <!--   That is, I will not be available 24/7 at a moment's notice, but if -->
      <!--   you need to speak to me outside of class, send me an email and we -->
      <!--   will either handle the issue by email or we will find a mutually -->
      <!--   convenient time to meet online. -->
      <p>
  Office hours exist so you can speak to your faculty one-on-one. My
        office hours are posted. If you are not free during any of my
        posted office hours let me know and we'll work out a mutually
        convenient time to speak.
      </p>
      </li>
      <li><title> Email</title>
      <p>
        My Penn State email address is
        <alert>ecb5@psu.edu</alert>. Any email that you send via
        Canvas also gets forwarded to this address.  Feel free to use
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <alert>However</alert> I get <em>a lot</em> of
        email at this address so it is easy for yours to get lost in
        the mix. I urge you not to rely on it. If I see your email here
        I will respond but it could easily take me several days to see
        it, or I might miss it entirely.
      </p>
</li>
<li>
<title> If I Don't Respond to an Email</title>
      <!-- <p> -->
      <!--   Your emails are important to me, but I get <alert>many</alert> -->
      <!--   emails every day at multiple addresses. It is easy to miss the -->
      <!--   important ones. -->
      <!-- </p> -->
      <p>
        If you send me an email and I do not respond it does not mean
        that I hate you, or that I'm ignoring you. It simply means
        that I didn't see it.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I see it I <em>will</em> respond. If I don't respond in a
        reasonable time please send it again. Or, if there is no rush,
        bring your the issue to me during the next class.
      </p>
      <!-- <p> -->
      <!--   Better yet, bring it to me during class in the first place. -->
      <!-- </p> -->
