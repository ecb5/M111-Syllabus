<section><title>How to Succeed in this Course</title>
<p>
  Because you learn math by doing math your grade in this course will
  depend on 
<ol>
<li>  Your success at solving problems take from the
  textbook(s) the practice problems, the exams, the quizzes, and the
  Webwork and
</li> 
<li> Your diligence in <em> trying </em> to solve those
  problems.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
 So the recipe for success is simple: Work through and solve as many
 problems, from as many sources as you possibly can.  You must do this
 yourself. No one can do it for you.  My role is to help you think
 clearly about how to approach a problem, how solve it, and how to
 know that you have solved it.
</p>
<p>
  I will begin every class session by asking if there are any
  questions. This is your opportunity to learn. If you have been
  working unsuccessfully on a problem, or if you have solved a problem
  but are still not sure that you understand it, ask about it in class
  and we will all discuss it then.
</p>
<p>
  I do not guarantee that I will solve the problem for you (although
  sometimes I might). That is not my role. My role is to help you
  understand the mathematics you are here to learn. Most often I will
  simply give you a push in the right direction, tell you to try
  again, and suggest that you ask again if you still can't make any
  progress.
