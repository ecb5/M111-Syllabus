<section><title>How to Succeed in this Course</title>
<p>
  Because you learn math by doing math your ability to
  <alert>solve</alert> some subset of <alert>problems</alert> in the
  textbook(s), the On-Line Exercises, the exams, the quizzes, and
  Webwork, will determine the majority of your grade in this course.
</p>
<p>
 So the recipe for success is simple: Work through and solve as many
 problems, from as many sources as you possibly can.  You must do this
 yourself. No one can do it for you.  My role is to help you think
 clearly about how to approach a problem, how solve it, and to know
 that you have solved it.
</p>
<p>
  I will begin every class session by asking if there are any
  questions. This is your opportunity to learn. If you have been
  working unsuccessfully on a problem, or if you have solved a problem
  but are still not sure that you understand it, ask about it in class
  and we will all discuss it then.
</p>
<p>
  I do not guarantee that I will solve the problem for you
  (although sometimes I might). That is not my role. My role is to
  help you understand the mathematics you are here to learn. Most often  I
  will simply  give you a push in the right direction, and tell you to
  try again and ask again if you still can't make any progress.
