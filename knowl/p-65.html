<dt>Raise your hand during class and ask your question</dt>

<div class="para">Some questions might involve personal information that you don’t want to share with the rest of the class. Simple matters can be handled quickly before or after class. If the issue is more complex we can arrange to meet another time.</div>
<div class="para">If you are not free immediately before or after class but need to speak to me let me know and we’ll work out a mutually convenient time to speak.</div>

<div class="para">
<em class="alert">However</em> I do not sit at my desk and continuously monitor my email. Sometimes it will take time for me to respond. Usually you will get a response by the next day at the latest, expecially if I don’t see your email until late in the day.</div>

<dd>
<div class="para">If you send me an email and I do not respond it does not mean that I hate you, or that I’m ignoring you. It simply means that I didn’t see it.</div>
<div class="para">If I see your email I will make every possible effort to respond. If I don’t respond in a reasonable time please send it again. Or, if there is no rush, bring your the issue to me during the next class. I’d rather talk to you in person anyway.</div>
