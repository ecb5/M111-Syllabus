<div class="para">It is extremely unwise to wait until the night a set of WeBWorK problems is due to begin doing them.  This is because it will not be clear how to do some of the problems the first time you look at them. If you don't start on them until the night they are due you will not have a chance to ask about them in class, so you will not learn what you need to learn from those problems. This will be reflected in your exam grades and your final course grade.</div>
