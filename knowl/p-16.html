<div class="para">It is perfectly acceptable to be unable to solve a problem or answer a question in class. It is not acceptable to refuse to discuss the problem.  For example, suppose call on you to share your solution to some problem, but you haven't been able to finish it.  It is perfectly acceptable to say, "I wasn't able to finish."  In that case I'll ask you to explain  whatever progress you have made and the discussion will continue. It is not acceptable to say, "I don't know. Call on someone else." and then refuse to discuss the problem further. You will lose your participation points for that day.  I do not expect you will able to correctly answer any random question that I throw at you. But I do expect you to participate in the classroom discussions.</div>
