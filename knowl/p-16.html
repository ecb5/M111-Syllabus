<div class="para">It is perfectly acceptable to be unable to solve a problem or answer a question in class. It is <em class="alert">not</em> acceptable to refuse to discuss the problem.  For example, suppose I ask you to solve a problem but you aren't able to finish it. If I then call on you to share your answer it is perfectly acceptable to say, "I wasn't able to finish." In that case I'll ask you to explain what you did to solve the problem and the discussion will continue. It is <em class="alert">not</em> acceptable to say, "I don't know. Call on someone else." and then refuse to discuss the problem further. You will lose your participation points for that day.  I do not expect you will able to correctly answer any random question that I throw at you. But I <em class="alert">do</em> expect you to <em class="alert">participate</em>.</div>
