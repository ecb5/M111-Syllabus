<div class="para">Teaching others is also a good way to refine and deepen your understanding.   A secondary goal for having you solve problems in class rather than on your own is so that you can learn from each other as well as from me. If I throw out a problem that you find easy, look around for a classmate who is struggling and offer to help them out. You will learn as much as the student you are helping. Who knows, you might even make a friend.</div>
